The editing of an audio consists in cutting and connecting together different elements of type audio (referred to as <b>audio components</b>): each component has a unique <b>identifier</b>, to be distinguished by the ID in the database of the corresponding audio.\n<br/><br/>\nEach audio component contains a <b>cutter</b> (used to select a portion of the original audio), the standard player controls, and a <b>sorting handle</b>. To use the controls of a component, first it must be <b>selected</b> (using the function {{#crossLink \"AudioEditorComponents/selectAudioEditorComponent:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}): if a component is not selected, it's shown with opacity and without the player controls. The functionality of sorting components is handled in {{#crossLink \"AudioEditorDocumentReady/audioEditorDocumentReadyGeneral:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}; the functionalities of player commands, together with the most important functionalities of the cutter, are located in the module {{#crossLinkModule \"players\"}}{{/crossLinkModule}} (class {{#crossLink \"PlayersAudioEditor\"}}{{/crossLink}}); the only functionalities of the cutter located in this module are found in the class {{#crossLink \"AudioEditorCutters\"}}{{/crossLink}} and in the method {{#crossLink \"AudioEditorDocumentReady/audioEditorDocumentReadyCutters:method\"}}{{/crossLink}} (functionality of precision arrows).\n<br/><br/>\nOn the top of the right column are positioned the time durations (updated with {{#crossLink \"AudioEditorComponents/changeDurationAudioEditorComponent:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}), ad the button 'plus' used to open the audio gallery (see the class {{#crossLink \"AudioEditorGalleries\"}}{{/crossLink}} and the method {{#crossLink \"AudioEditorDocumentReady/audioEditorDocumentReadyGeneral:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}).\n<br/><br/>\nOn the bottom of the right column are positioned the controls for the <b>global preview</b> (which plays all the components globally). Similarly to the module {{#crossLinkModule \"video-editor\"}}{{/crossLinkModule}}, before playing the global preview the system must enter in <b>preview mode</b>: the difference is that in the Audio Editor this mode is switched automatically by the system, whereas in the Video Editor it's the user who decides to enter and leave the preview mode. To enter in preview mode we use the method {{#crossLink \"AudioEditorPreview/enterAudioEditorPreviewMode:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}, which calls {{#crossLink \"AudioEditorPreview/switchAudioComponentsToPreviewMode:method\"}}{{/crossLink}} or each component. A component in preview mode can be <b>selected</b> (using a differente method respect to the normal component selection: see {{#crossLink \"AudioEditorPreview/selectAudioEditorComponentInPreviewMode:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}). Each component in the global preview is played using the method {{#crossLink \"AudioEditorPreview/startAudioEditorPreview:method\"}}{{/crossLink}} (to which we pass the component to start with); the main part of the functionality of passing from a component to the next one during the global preview is handled in the module {{#crossLinkModule \"players\"}}{{/crossLinkModule}} (more specificly, in the method {{#crossLink \"PlayersAudioEditor/initializeActionOfMediaTimeUpdaterInAudioEditor:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}.\n<br/><br/>\nAs for the other Element Editors ({{#crossLinkModule \"image-editor\"}}{{/crossLinkModule}}, {{#crossLinkModule \"video-editor\"}}{{/crossLinkModule}}) the core of the process of committing changes is handled in the module {{#crossLinkModule \"media-element-editor\"}}{{/crossLinkModule}} (more specificly in the class {{#crossLink \"MediaElementEditorForms\"}}{{/crossLink}}); the part of this functionality specific for the Audio Editor is handled in {{#crossLink \"MediaElementEditorDocumentReady/mediaElementEditorDocumentReady:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}."

Similarly, clicking on the icon 'texts', the user enters in <b>texts insertion mode</b>: this means that clicking on the image he can create small editable text areas that will be added on the image (see the initializer {{#crossLink \"ImageEditorDocumentReady/imageEditorDocumentReadyTexts:method\"}}{{/crossLink}} and the class {{#crossLink \"ImageEditorTexts\"}}{{/crossLink}}). While the user is in crop mode or texts insertion mode, he can come back to the initial status of the editor clicking on one of the two buttons on the bottom right corner of the image: <b>cancel</b> resets the mode without applying the modifications, and <b>apply</b> does the same but saving the image first (the graphics of these operations is handled in the class {{#crossLink \"ImageEditorGraphics\"}}{{/crossLink}}).\n<br/><br/>\nThe image in editing is conserved in a temporary folder, together with the version of the image before the last step of editing.

The current slide is illuminated and editable, whereas the adhiacent slides are covered by a layer with opacity that prevents the user from editing them: if the user clicks on this layer, the application takes the slide below it as new current slide and moves it to the center of the screen (see {{#crossLink \"LessonEditorDocumentReady/lessonEditorDocumentReadySlidesNavigator:method\"}}{{/crossLink}} and the methods in {{#crossLink \"LessonEditorSlidesNavigation\"}}{{/crossLink}}): only after this operation, the user can edit that particular slide. To avoid overloading when there are many slides containing media, the slides are instanced all together but their content is loaded only when the user moves to them (see the methods in {{#crossLink \"LessonEditorSlideLoading\"}}{{/crossLink}}).\n<br/><br/>\nOn the right side of each slide the user finds a list of <b>buttons</b> (initialized in {{#crossLink \"LessonEditorDocumentReady/lessonEditorDocumentReadySlideButtons:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}): each button corresponds either to an action that can be performed on the slide, either to an action that can be performed to the whole lesson (for instance, save and exit, or edit title description and tags).\n<br/><br/>\nThe <b>tool to navigate the slides</b> is located on the top of the editor: each small square represents a slide (with its position), and passing with the mouse over it the Editor shows a miniature of the corresponding slide (these functionalities are initialized in {{#crossLink \"LessonEditorDocumentReady/lessonEditorDocumentReadySlidesNavigator:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}). Clicking on a slide miniature, the application moves to that slide using the function {{#crossLink \"LessonEditorSlidesNavigation/slideTo:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}. The slides can be sorted dragging with the mouse (using the JQueryUi plugin, initialized in {{#crossLink \"LessonEditorDocumentReady/lessonEditorDocumentReadyJqueryAnimations:method\"}}{{/crossLink}} and {{#crossLink \"LessonEditorJqueryAnimations/initializeSortableNavs:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}).\n<br/><br/>\nInside the Editor, there are two operations that require hiding and replacement of the queue of slides: <b>adding a media element to a slide</b> and <b>choosing a new slide</b>. In both these operations, an HTML div is extracted from the main template (where it was hidden), and put in the place of the current slide, hiding the rest of the slides queue, buttons, and slides navigation (operations performed by {{#crossLink \"LessonEditorCurrentSlide/hideEverythingOutCurrentSlide:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}). For the galleries, the extracted div must be filled by an action called via Ajax (see the module {{#crossLinkModule \"galleries\"}}{{/crossLinkModule}}), whereas the div with the list of available slides is already loaded with the Editor (see {{#crossLink \"LessonEditorDocumentReady/lessonEditorDocumentReadyNewSlideChoice:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}).\n<br/><br/>\nTo add a media element to a slide, the user picks it from its specific gallery: when he clicks on the button 'plus', the system calls the corresponding subfunction in {{#crossLink \"LessonEditorDocumentReady/lessonEditorDocumentReadyAddMediaElement:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}. To avoid troubles due to the replacement of JQuery plugins, video and audio tags, etc, this method always replaces the sources of <b>audio</b> and <b>video</b> tags and calls <i>load()</i>.\n<br/><br/>\nIf the element added is of type <b>image</b>, the user may drag it inside the slide, using {{#crossLink \"LessonEditorJqueryAnimations/makeDraggable:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}. A set of methods (in the class {{#crossLink \"LessonEditorImageResizing\"}}{{/crossLink}}) is available to resize the image and the alignment chosen by the user; more specificly, the method {{#crossLink \"LessonEditorImageResizing/isHorizontalMask:method\"}}{{/crossLink}} is used to understand, depending on the type of slide and on the proportions of the image, if the image is <b>vertical</b> (and then the user can drag it vertically) or <b>horizontal</b> (the user can drag it horizontally).\n<br/><br/>\nEach slide contains a form linked to the action that updates it, there is no global saving for the whole lesson. The slide is automaticly saved (using the method {{#crossLink \"LessonEditorForms/saveCurrentSlide:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}) <i>before moving to another slide</i>, <i>before showing the options to add a new slide</i>, and <i>before changing position of a slide</i>. The same function is called by the user when he clicks on the button 'save' on the right of each slide; the buttons <b>save and exit</b> and <b>edit general info</b> are also linked to slide saving, but in this case it's performed with a callback (see again the buttons initialization in {{#crossLink \"LessonEditorDocumentReady/lessonEditorDocumentReadySlideButtons:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}).\n<br/><br/>\nThe text slides are provided of <b>TinyMCE</b> text editor, initialized in the methods of {{#crossLink \"LessonEditorTinyMCE\"}}{{/crossLink}}."

Both modes use the same JQuery plugin called <i>JQueryAutocomplete</i> (the same used in {{#crossLink \"AdminAutocomplete/initNotificationsAutocomplete:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}).\n<br/><br/>\nThe <b>search</b> autocomplete mode requires a simple initializer (method {{#crossLink \"TagsInitializers/initSearchTagsAutocomplete:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}), which is called for three different keyword inputs of the search engine (the general one, the one for elements and the one for lessons).\n<br/><br/>\nThe <b>tagging</b> autocomplete mode is slightly more complicated, because it must show to the user a friendly view of the tags he added (small boxes with an 'x' to remove it) and at the same time store a string value to be send to the rails backend. The implemented solution is a <b>container</b> div that contains a list of tag <b>boxes</b> (implemented with span, see {{#crossLink \"TagsAccessories/createTagSpan:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}) and an <b>tag input</b> where the user writes; when he inserts a new tag and presses <i>enter</i> or <i>comma</i>, the tag is added to the previous line in the container; if such a line is full, the tag input is moved to the next line; when the lines in the container are over, the tag input gets disabled (see {{#crossLink \"TagsAccessories/disableTagsInputTooHigh:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}). During this whole process, a <b>hidden input</b> gets updated with a string representing the current tags separated by comma ({{#crossLink \"TagsAccessories/addToTagsValue:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}, {{#crossLink \"TagsAccessories/removeFromTagsValue:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}).\n<br/><br/>\nThe system also checks if the inserted tag is not repeated (using {{#crossLink \"TagsAccessories/checkNoTagDuplicates:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}), and assigns a different color for tags already in the database and for new ones ({{#crossLink \"TagsAccessories/addTagWithoutSuggestion:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}).\n<br/><br/>\nThe <b>tagging autocomplete mode</b> is initialized using the scope class '_tags_container' which is unique (see method {{#crossLink \"TagsInitializers/tagsDocumentReady:method\"}}{{/crossLink}})."

On the <b>timeline</b> the user may perform the following actions:\n<ul>\n  <li><b>add</b> a new component (see class {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorAddComponents\"}}{{/crossLink}}) or <b>replace</b> an existing one, even without maintaining its original type (see class {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorReplaceComponents\"}}{{/crossLink}}): these functionalities are initialized in {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorDocumentReady/videoEditorDocumentReadyAddComponent:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}</li>\n  <li><b>remove</b> a component from the timeline (initialized in {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorDocumentReady/videoEditorDocumentReadyRemoveComponent:method\"}}{{/crossLink}})</li>\n  <li><b>sort</b> and change the order of the components (initialized in {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorDocumentReady/videoEditorDocumentReadyInitialization:method\"}}{{/crossLink}})</li>\n  <li><b>cut</b> a video component (change its initial and final point) or <b>change duration</b> of an image or text compoent (both these functionalities are initialized in {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorDocumentReady/videoEditorDocumentReadyCutters:method\"}}{{/crossLink}} and implemented in the class {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorCutters\"}}{{/crossLink}}).</li>\n</ul>\nEach component is provided of its own <b>identifier</b> (similar to the one used in {{#crossLinkModule \"audio-editor\"}}{{/crossLinkModule}}), that is unique and doesn't change on any operation performed by the user. Moreover, regardless of its type, a component is strictly linked with two <b>external accessories</b>:\n<ul>\n  <li>a <b>cutter</b> (whose HTML id is <i>video component [identifier] cutter</i>): this item is normally hidden, when requested it appears below the timeline and is used to cut a video component or change the duration of an image or text component (class {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorCutters\"}}{{/crossLink}})</li>\n  <li>a <b>preview clip</b> (whose HTML id is <i>video component [identifier] preview</i>): this item is hidden inside the <b>preview screen</b>, and it's used\n    <ul>\n      <li>to provide the user of a big clip of the component while handling it (functionality initialized in {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorDocumentReady/videoEditorDocumentReadyComponentsCommon:method\"}}{{/crossLink}})</li>\n      <li>to play a video component while cutting it (initialized in the method {{#crossLink \"PlayersDocumentReady/playersDocumentReadyVideoEditor:method\"}}{{/crossLink}} in the module {{#crossLinkModule \"players\"}}{{/crossLinkModule}})</li>\n      <li>to be shown in the <b>global preview</b> (see class {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorPreview\"}}{{/crossLink}}).</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\nThe method that <b>extracts the identifier from a component</b> is {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorGeneral/getVideoComponentIdentifier:method\"}}{{/crossLink}} (it works receiving as parameter either the component or its cutter or preview clip).\n<br/><br/>\nWhile the user is working, the <b>preview clip</b> visible in the preview screen corresponds to the last component <b>selected</b> by the user. A component gets selected either if the user keeps the mouse on it for more than half a second (using the method {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorComponents/startVideoEditorPreviewClipWithDelay:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}, which avoids compulsive changes inside the preview screen when the user passes with the mouse over the timeline), or immediately on the actions of <b>sorting</b> and <b>cutting</b> (using the method {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorCutters/startVideoEditorPreviewClip:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}): both behaviors are initialized in {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorDocumentReady/videoEditorDocumentReadyComponentsCommon:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}. To the <b>preview clip</b> of a video component is also associated a method ({{#crossLink \"VideoEditorGeneral/loadVideoComponentIfNotLoadedYet:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}) that loads the HTML5 video tag only when necessary: this, similarly to {{#crossLinkModule \"audio-editor\"}}{{/crossLinkModule}}, avoids overloading of the HTML.\n<br/><br/>\nThe <b>component gallery</b> used inside the Video Editor (initialized in {{#crossLink \"GalleriesInitializers/initializeMixedGalleryInVideoEditor:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}) is the only gallery in the application which contains mixed types of elements. It's divided into three sections, one for each kind of component: the sections for <b>video</b> and <b>image</b> components have the same external behavior of normal image and video galleries (see the module {{#crossLinkModule \"galleries\"}}{{/crossLinkModule}}), whereas the section for <b>text</b> components is a peculiar text editor (see the class {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorTextComponentEditor\"}}{{/crossLink}}). The component gallery (together with the regular audio gallery for the <b>audio track</b>) is initialized in {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorDocumentReady/videoEditorDocumentReadyGalleries:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}, and its functionality defined in the methods of {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorGalleries\"}}{{/crossLink}} (for instance, the method to switch from a section to another).\n<br/><br/>\nThe method {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorDocumentReady/videoEditorDocumentReadyAddComponent:method\"}}{{/crossLink}} initializes the general procedure to <b>add or replace a component</b>. The system sets a HTML <i>data</i> that records if the component gallery was opened to <b>replace</b> or <b>add</b> a component: depending on this data, when the user picks a component from the gallery it's called the corresponding method in {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorAddComponents\"}}{{/crossLink}} or in {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorReplaceComponents\"}}{{/crossLink}}.\n<br/><br/>\nWhen the user adds a component, the system makes a copy of an <b>empty hidden component</b> and fills it with the new data. This behavior is quite similar to the one in {{#crossLinkModule \"audio-editor\"}}{{/crossLinkModule}}, but in the case of Video Editor the procedure is slightly more complicated, due to the following reasons:\n<ul>\n  <li>there are <b>three empty items</b> (empty component, empty cutter, empty preview clip) for each type of component, <b>for a total of nine</b></li>\n  <li>unlike {{#crossLinkModule \"audio-editor\"}}{{/crossLinkModule}}, in the Video Editor each component needs a <b>miniature</b>, that necessarily must be inserted in the empty component <b>together with the rest of the data</b>. For text components, the miniature is built in the moment of the component's creation (there is an <b>empty text miniature</b> hidden in the template of text component editor, see {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorTextComponentEditor\"}}{{/crossLink}}); for video and image components, the miniatures are loaded together with the <b>mixed gallery</b> and stored <b>in the popup of each element</b> (see module {{#crossLinkModule \"galleries\"}}{{/crossLinkModule}}, and especially the <i>js.erb</i> templates associated to the routes of the mixed gallery)\n  <li>in the Video Editor it's possible to <b>replace</b> a component: when the system does this, it's not enough to fill the inputs of the previous component (with {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorComponents/fillVideoEditorSingleParameter:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}): it's additionally necessary to <b>reset the inputs</b> of the previous component, thing done by the method {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorComponents/clearSpecificVideoEditorComponentParameters:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}. Moreover, when replacing a component, the duration is updated using {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorComponents/changeDurationVideoEditorComponent:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}.</li>\n</ul>\nBesides the durations, two graphical details are peculiar to each component: the <b>position</b>, handled by {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorComponents/reloadVideoEditorComponentPositions:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}; and the <b>transition</b>, a small icon representing the <b>fade transition</b> of one second between a component and the following, that must be visible <i>after all components except for the last one</i> (see {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorComponents/resetVisibilityOfVideoEditorTransitions:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}). The operations in which callback it's necessary to reset transitions and positions are <b>sorting</b> ({{#crossLink \"VideoEditorDocumentReady/videoEditorDocumentReadyInitialization:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}) and <b>removing</b> ({{#crossLink \"VideoEditorDocumentReady/videoEditorDocumentReadyRemoveComponent:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}).\n<br/><br/>\nA video component cutter (or simply <b>cutter</b>) is an instrument used to change the initial and final second of a component of type video: it's very similar to the audio cutter, and its functionalities (JQueryUi sliders, players, etc) are defined in {{#crossLink \"PlayersVideoEditor/initializeVideoInVideoEditorPreview:method\"}}{{/crossLink}} and {{#crossLink \"PlayersDocumentReady/playersDocumentReadyVideoEditor:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}. A property that is worth mentioning is the <b>automatic return to the previous integer second</b> when pausing: this is a functionality of both cutters and global reproduction (see {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorDocumentReady/videoEditorDocumentReadyPreview:method\"}}{{/crossLink}} and {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorPreview\"}}{{/crossLink}}), necessary to set with precision the current time of the <b>preview screen</b>, in order to simulate faithfully the effect of transitions and the correspondance with the optional audio track.\n<br/><br/>\nFor image and text components, a cutter is simply a small form where the user may insert a new duration (the associated callback is {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorComponents/changeDurationVideoEditorComponent:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}. Since it doesn't fit the whole timeline, this paraticular cutter must be aligned to the JScrollPain: this is done with the functions of the class {{#crossLink \"MediaElementEditorHorizontalTimelines\"}}{{/crossLink}}.\n<br/><br/>\nAll the cutters are initialized in {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorDocumentReady/videoEditorDocumentReadyCutters:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}, and their functionalities included in the class {{#crossLink \"AudioEditorCutters\"}}{{/crossLink}}.\n<br/><br/>\nThe <b>text component editor</b> can be opened clicking on the icon 'T' in the header of the component editor (see method {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorGalleries/switchToOtherGalleryInMixedGalleryInVideoEditor:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}). The user can insert a text and choose background and text color: the functionality is initialized in {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorDocumentReady/videoEditorDocumentReadyTextComponentEditor:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}, and the main methods are contained in the class {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorTextComponentEditor\"}}{{/crossLink}}. Notice that, unlike image and video components, the <b>miniature</b> of a text component is created in the moment of the insertion of the compoent (see both {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorAddComponents/addTextComponentInVideoEditor:method\"}}{{/crossLink}} and {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorReplaceComponents/replaceTextComponentInVideoEditor:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}).\n<br/><br/>\nThe <b>optional audio track</b> is added clicking on the button on the bottom. When the user opens the audio gallery and selects an audio, the system automatically sets <i>muted</i> as <i>true</i> in all the video components ({{#crossLink \"VideoEditorDocumentReady/videoEditorDocumentReadyAudioTrack:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}); when adding or replacing a video component (see both {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorAddComponents/addVideoComponentInVideoEditor:method\"}}{{/crossLink}} and {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorReplaceComponents/replaceVideoComponentInVideoEditor:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}) the attribute <i>muted</i> is inserted if an audio track is present.\n<br/><br/>\nThe audio track is handled while playing a video component inside the video cutter (class {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorCutters\"}}{{/crossLink}}): the system ensures that the starting of the audio corresponds to the position of the selected video component inside the whole video, using the methods {{#crossLink \"PlayersDocumentReady/playersDocumentReadyVideoEditor:method\"}}{{/crossLink}} and {{#crossLink \"PlayersVideoEditor/initializeActionOfMediaTimeUpdaterInVideoEditor:method\"}}{{/crossLink}} of the module {{#crossLinkModule \"players\"}}{{/crossLinkModule}}.\n<br/><br/>\nUnlike the {{#crossLinkModule \"audio-editor\"}}{{/crossLinkModule}}, in Video Editor the <b>preview mode</b> is not left automatically when the user stops the global preview: The system has different behaviors for each item in the editor while being in preview mode. While the global preview is playing it sets to true the HTML data <b>preview mode in-use</b>.\n<br/><br/>\nWhile in preview mode, the <b>preview</b> button in the right column is substituted by a button <b>play / pause</b>; the <i>arrow</i> on the bottom used to commit changes (see {{#crossLink \"MediaElementEditorDocumentReady/mediaElementEditorDocumentReady:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}) is replaced by <b>a button 'X'</b> that is used to leave the preview mode. Furthermore, in preview mode many graphical details are slightly changed respect to the normal mode (for instance it's not possible to open the cutters, remove components, etc).\n<br/><br/>\nThe general methods relative to the preview mode are contained in {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorPreview\"}}{{/crossLink}}; the method to enter in preview mode is {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorPreview/openPreviewModeInVideoEditor:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}; the initializer, which contains also the functionality of <b>leaving</b> the preview mode, is {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorDocumentReady/videoEditorDocumentReadyPreview:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}.\n<br/><br/>\nWhile in preview mode, it's possible to start the global preview (starting <b>from the selected component at the selected second</b>) using the method {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorPreview/startVideoEditorGlobalPreview:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}: this method is automatically fired with the first component selectedm when the user opens the preview mode for the first time. The method to <b>play a component</b> is {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorPreview/playVideoEditorComponent:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}; the functionality of passing from a component to another is placed in the last method (if the last component was of type <b>image</b> or <b>text</b>), and in {{#crossLink \"PlayersVideoEditor/initializeActionOfMediaTimeUpdaterInVideoEditor:method\"}}{{/crossLink}} (it it's of type <b>video</b>, in which case the behavior differs slightly).\n<br/><br/>\nUnlike in {{#crossLinkModule \"audio-editor\"}}{{/crossLinkModule}}, there are <b>two methods for increasing the global time</b>: the regular one is {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorPreview/increaseVideoEditorPreviewTimer:method\"}}{{/crossLink}} (used to increase the time according to the <b>currentTime</b> of a video component), and the automatic one is {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorPreview/automaticIncreaseVideoEditorPreviewTimer:method\"}}{{/crossLink}} (used for automatic increase while playing image and text components).\n<br/><br/>\nAnother important difference with {{#crossLinkModule \"audio-editor\"}}{{/crossLinkModule}} is the reproduction of the <b>one second transitions</b> between two components: if the user clicks on <i>pause</i> while the global preview is playing a transition, the method that is playing the component (as we have already seen, it can be either {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorPreview/playVideoEditorComponent:method\"}}{{/crossLink}} or {{#crossLink \"PlayersVideoEditor/initializeActionOfMediaTimeUpdaterInVideoEditor:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}) waits until the transition is over to stop the reproduction.\n<br/><br/>\nIn the class {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorPreviewAccessories\"}}{{/crossLink}} are stored the methods to handle the instruments available for the user to get to a specific position inside the timeline during preview mode. Such instruments (initialized in {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorDocumentReady/videoEditorDocumentReadyPreview:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}) are:\n<ul>\n  <li>the <b>arrows</b> that allow the user to pass from a component to another</li>\n  <li>the <b>precision bar</b> that allows the user to select a specific point inside the selected component: notice that this bar is implemented with a <i>JQueryUi slider</i> which is destroyed and re-initialized at each component change (using the methods {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorPreviewAccessories/showVideoEditorPreviewComponentProgressBar:method\"}}{{/crossLink}} and {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorPreviewAccessories/hideVideoEditorPreviewComponentProgressBar:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}).</li>\n</ul>\nBoth precision instruments use the general method {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorPreviewAccessories/selectVideoComponentInPreview:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}, that allows to select a component at a specific time.\n<br/><br/>\nTo include the <b>background audio track</b> in the global preview, the system uses the method {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorPreviewAccessories/calculateVideoComponentStartSecondInVideoEditor:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}, which calculates <b>the total amount of seconds</b> until the selected point, including the time necessary for the transitions.\n<br/><br/>\nFinally, let's have a look at the functionalities of the JScrollPain: the method {{#crossLink \"VideoEditorScrollPain/followPreviewComponentsWithHorizontalScrollInVideoEditor:method\"}}{{/crossLink}} is called at any time the selected component changes inside the preview mode (that is, either while reproducing the global preview, or if the user changes component using the arrows); this method re-implements many functionalities that were badly implemented or absent in the original plugin, such as for instance the uniform speed to scroll different amounts of components. The method uses the class {{#crossLink \"MediaElementEditorHorizontalTimelines\"}}{{/crossLink}}\n<br/><br/>\nAs for the other Element Editors ({{#crossLinkModule \"image-editor\"}}{{/crossLinkModule}}, {{#crossLinkModule \"audio-editor\"}}{{/crossLinkModule}}) the core of the process of committing changes is handled in the module {{#crossLinkModule \"media-element-editor\"}}{{/crossLinkModule}} (more specificly in the class {{#crossLink \"MediaElementEditorForms\"}}{{/crossLink}}); the part of this functionality specific for the Video Editor is handled in {{#crossLink \"MediaElementEditorDocumentReady/mediaElementEditorDocumentReady:method\"}}{{/crossLink}}."
