  # SECTION 3.3: Locations
  # 
  # The structure of locations in the application is organized as follows:
  #   1) in SETTINGS['location_types'] you can configure an array containing the different levels of locations (ordered from external to internal. A likely example of location configuration would be ['Province', 'District', 'City']
  #   2) once the administrator has configured the location levels, in the database the table 'locations' is split with single table inheritance, and a model is generated for each location type configured
  #   3) each time the application need to show data concerning the location of a user (or his lessons / media elements), two separate columns are generated:
  #      (a) a column labelled with the name of the lower location (in the example above: 'City' : 'Shanghai')
  #      (b) a column containing the chain the higher locations associated to the lower one (ordered from lower to higher, separated by '-', in our case would be something like 'Shanghai district - Shanghai province')
  
  locations:
    # This array of labels corresponds to the ordered ist configured in SETTINGS['location_types']: the strings in that list are used to NAME THE MODELS, and for this reason they should use english characters, whereas this array specifies the local translation for each model.
