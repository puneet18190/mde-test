  # SECTION 3.3: Locations
  # 
  # The structure of locations in the application is organized as follows:
  #   1) in SETTINGS['location_types'] you can configure an array containing the different levels of locations (ordered from external to internal. A likely example of location configuration would be ['Province', 'District', 'City']
  #   2) once the administrator has configured the location levels, in the database the table 'locations' is split with single table inheritance, and a model is generated for each location type configured
  #   3) each time the application need to show data concerning the location of a user (or his lessons / media elements), two separate columns are generated:
  #      (a) a column labelled with the name of the lower location (in the example above: 'City' : 'Shanghai')
  #      (b) a column containing the chain the higher locations associated to the lower one (ordered from lower to higher, separated by '-', in our case would be something like 'Shanghai district - Shanghai province')
  
  locations:
    # This array of labels corresponds to the ordered ist configured in SETTINGS['location_types']: the strings in that list are used to NAME THE MODELS, and for this reason they should use english characters, whereas this array specifies the local translation for each model.
    labels:
